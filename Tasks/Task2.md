# Task 2

### Where we are

We have a few basic tests. Letâ€™s add a few more, with more complicated logic and Xpath.

### Task

Implement tests described in Part2 file of your variant.

### Result

We have a bunch of very similar tests. As you can imagine, writing tests in this manner will very quickly make them impossible to maintain (any small change will force us to modify many tests). In the next part, we will start working on reducing the duplication.
